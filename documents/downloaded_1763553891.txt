Kido, Longji Li, Giovanni Melina, Marina Mendes Tavares, and Philippe Wingender. "The Global Impact of AI: Mind the Gap", IMF Working Papers 2025, 076 (2025), accessed 11/19/2025, https://doi.org/10.5089/9798229008570.001Export Citation.risProCiteRefWorksReference Manager.bibBibTexZotero.enwEndNoteDisclaimer: IMF Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to encourage debate. The views expressed in IMF Working Papers are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF, its Executive Board, or IMF management.SummaryThis paper examines the uneven global impact of AI, highlighting how its effects will be a function of (i) countries’ sectoral exposure to AI, (ii) their preparedness to integrate these technologies into their economies, and (iii) their access to essential data and technologies. We feed these three aspects into a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model of the global economy and show that AI will exacerbate cross-country income inequality, disproportionately benefiting advanced economies. Indeed, the estimated growth impact in advanced economies could be more than double that in low-income countries. While improvements in AI preparedness and access can mitigate these disparities, they are unlikely to fully offset them. Moreover, the AI-driven productivity gains could reduce the traditional role of exchange rate adjustments due to AI’s large impact in the non-tradable sector—a mechanism akin to an inverse Balassa-Samuelson effect.Subject: Emerging and frontier financial markets, Financial markets, Production, Productivity, Total factor productivityKeywords: Africa, AI gap, AI preparedness, Artificial Intelligence, Asia and Pacific, Caribbean, Emerging and frontier financial markets, Global, IMF working paper No. 25/76, Middle East, Multi-Region DSGE Model, preparedness scenario, Productivity, productivity gain, Total factor productivityPublication DetailsPages:33Volume:2025DOI:https://doi.org/10.5089/9798229008570.001Issue:076Series:Working Paper No. 2025/076Stock No:WPIEA2025076ISBN:9798229008570ISSN:1018-5941You May Also Be Interested In...Tourism in the Post-Pandemic World: Economic Challenges and Opportunities for Asia-Pacific and the Western Hemisphere: November 202511/3/2025Enhancing Tax Capacity: Revenue Gains from Strengthening Tax Administration10/24/2025The Evolving Growth Model of Lithuania: Republic of Lithuania10/13/2025Potential Growth and Migration: Republic of Lithuania10/13/2025Allocative Efficiency, Firm Dynamics, and Productivity in Latvia: Republic of Latvia10/7/2025
