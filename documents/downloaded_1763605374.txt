Algebra is the branch of mathematics with the following properties.Deals with symbols (or variables) and rules for manipulating these symbols. Elementary (Taught in Schools) Algebra mainly deals with variables and operations like sum, power, subtraction, etc. For example,
x + 10 = 100, x2 - 2x + 1 = 5 and x + y = 20. Abstract Algebra (Taught in Colleges) deals with groups, rings, and fields instead of normal variables (representing numbers).In this article, we are mainly going to focus on Elementary algebra.Example: A father is 30 years older than his son. The combined age of both father and son is 60 years. You are asked to find the individual ages of the father and the son.Real-life Equation:Let x represent the son's age.The father's age will then be x + 30, since the father is 30 years older than the son.The sum of their ages is 60, so the equation becomes: x + (x + 30) = 60Algebraic Equation: 2x + 30 = 60.Algebra for Beginners & School StudentsThis section covers key algebra concepts, including expressions, equations, operations, and methods for solving linear and quadratic equations, along with polynomials and factorization.Basics of AlgebraBranches of AlgebraAlgebraic ExpressionsAlgebraic EquationsOne-step EquationsExpression and EquationsAlgebraic Operations & PropertiesLinear equation in one VariableLinear Equation in Two VariablesPair of Linear Equation in Two VariablesSolving Pair of Linear Equation in Two VariablesSubstitution MethodElimination MethodCross Multiplication MethodQuadratic EquationsQuadratic FormulaAlgebraic IdentitiesPolynomials Degree of PolynomialFactorization of PolynomialZeroes of a PolynomialFactor Theorem and Remainder Theorem Linear Inequalities Algebra vs CalculusAlgebra for Aptitude PreparationThis section covers key algebra formulas and tricks to boost your aptitude skills and improve exam performance.Algebra FormulasAlgebra Tricks for AptitudeAlgebra Aptitude Questions & AnswersAlgebra Practice QuestionsThis section offers a variety of algebra practice questions at different difficulty levels, including linear and quadratic equations, to help you sharpen your skills and prepare for exams.Algebra Practice Questions (Easy Level)Algebra Practice Questions (Medium Level)Algebra Practice Questions (Hard Level)Practice Problems on Linear Equation in Two VariablesPractice Questions on Quadratic EquationsAlgebra Practice Quiz Algebra for ProgrammersThis section focuses on algebra concepts for programmers, including coding solutions for linear and quadratic equations, finding missing values, and determining the maximum and minimum values of algebraic expressions.Find number of solutions of a linear equation of n variablesProgram to find number of solutions in Quadratic EquationProgram to find the Roots of Quadratic equationFind the missing value from the given equation a + b = cMaximum and Minimum Values of an Algebraic Expression
